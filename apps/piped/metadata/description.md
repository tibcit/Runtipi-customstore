## A privacy‑friendly YouTube front‑end built for efficiency

Piped is an open‑source alternative front‑end to YouTube designed to protect your privacy and reduce resource usage.  It strips out ads and tracking scripts and delivers video via a lightweight interface【831232061929096†L38-L63】.  Users can switch between light and dark themes, enjoy infinite scrolling, log in to manage subscriptions and playlists, and even watch videos in audio‑only mode or at 4K resolution【831232061929096†L38-L63】.  The interface stores your preferences locally and can import or export data to other clients like LibreTube or NewPipe.

Beyond the user‑facing features, Piped includes integrations with SponsorBlock and LBRY for enhanced playback options【831232061929096†L38-L63】.  It also offers embedded video support, bypasses some geo‑restrictions through federation, and avoids YouTube’s official API by using the NewPipe extractor【831232061929096†L63-L74】.  Under the hood, Piped can load‑balance across multiple regions and is built to handle thousands of concurrent users【831232061929096†L63-L69】.  A public JSON API and a federated Matrix protocol round out the technical capabilities【831232061929096†L63-L75】.

When self‑hosted within Runtipi, this app deploys the complete Piped stack — a frontend, backend, proxy and background helper along with a PostgreSQL database.  The frontend is exposed via Traefik, while the backend and auxiliary services communicate over the internal Docker network.  A minimal configuration file is provided, and you can further customise the instance by editing `config.properties` in the data folder.
