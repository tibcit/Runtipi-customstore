  "description": "Piped is an open‑source alternative front‑end to YouTube.  It allows you to watch YouTube videos without ads or tracking, supports both audio‑only mode and playlists, and offers features like light/dark themes, subscriptions independent from Google, notifications, and importer/exporter tools for other clients【831232061929096†L38-L63】.  Designed to be lightweight and efficient, it uses the NewPipe extractor rather than the official YouTube API and can scale to thousands of users【831232061929096†L38-L69】.",
